Food Express – Food Ordering Website
Food Express is a responsive and visually engaging food ordering web application built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on delivering a clean and intuitive frontend experience, allowing users to explore featured restaurants and popular dishes, and place orders with ease.

Project Overview:
The goal of Food Express is to simulate a modern food delivery platform with a rich user interface and seamless navigation — all created using only frontend technologies. Users can:

-Browse a curated list of featured restaurants

-View and select from popular dishes

-Enter delivery information to simulate placing an order

This project showcases frontend development skills such as responsive design, DOM manipulation, form handling, and layout structuring without any backend or database connectivity.

Technologies Used:

-HTML5 – For structuring the web content

-CSS3 – For styling, layout, and responsive design

-JavaScript (Vanilla) – For interactivity, user input handling, and dynamic UI updates

Features:

-Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile views

-Interactive UI with smooth scrolling and section transitions

-Order form to capture user delivery information

-Organized layout with restaurant highlights and dish cards

-Clean code structure with semantic HTML and modular CSS

Future Enhancements:

-User Login & Authentication

-Order History (My Orders) section

-Integration with backend (e.g., Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

-Enhanced mobile optimization and accessibility improvements

Purpose & Learning Outcomes:

This project helped me:

-Strengthen frontend development skills

-Understand responsive design principles

-Practice clean UI/UX design

-Work with real-world components like forms, menus, and cards

-Prepare for future integration with backend services
